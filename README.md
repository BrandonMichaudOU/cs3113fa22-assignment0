# How to Build and Run
Use `make all` to build the program. After the program is built, use `./a0` to run it. 
While running, enter integers to see the output. When you are done running the program press `ctrl + d` or enter a non-integer to exit.
After exitting the program, use `make clean` to remove the executable and object files.

# Bugs or Missing Features
This program has no known bugs.

# Help
The only sources of help I had on this project were lectures and the recordings of the lectures.
